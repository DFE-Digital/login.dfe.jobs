Dear <%=firstName%> <%=lastName%>,

You can no longer access the <%=serviceName%> using your old username and password.

You now need a DfE Sign-in account to access the service.

We have previously contacted you to set this up. You can do this now.

<%if(isApprover) { %>
    You have been invited to set up a DfE Sign-in approver account for <%=orgName%>.
    Approvers can manage other users at their organisation and add services to their account.
<% } %>

To create your account, please verify your email and set your password by selecting the button below or 
by visiting <%=returnUrl%> profile.sign-in.register.

Your verification code
<%=code%>

Your verification code will expire after 24 hours.

Find out more about why this change has happened <%=getmoreinfoUrl%>

Contact us for further help <%=helpUrl%> if you are having difficulty setting up your account.

Kind regards,

The Department for Education Sign-in Team
